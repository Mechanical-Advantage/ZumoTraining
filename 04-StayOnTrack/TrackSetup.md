# Line Following Track Setup

The track you will use to complete challenge #4 is built from modular sections. The full set of tiles is available [here](http://robotsquare.com/2012/11/28/line-following/), but in this challenge everyone will use the same design, seen below. This is created by connecting together square sections that you can print out at home.

We have a PDF ([Click here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mechanical-Advantage/SummerTraining2020/master/resources/04-old-printout.pdf)) that you can print out to get all of the necessary track sections. **Make sure you print out the PDF at 100% scale**, so that the pieces are the correct size.

You can attach the pieces together any way you see fit (taping together, gluing to a large board, etc.). Make sure that the robot can run smoothly from one section to the next. We found it useful to stick a long piece of clear tape along the borders to remove the gaps.
